    A class protocol allowing notification of a characteristic being listened on, and provides an opportunity to restore its listen callback during Bluetooth state restoration.
 
    Bluetooth state restoration occurs when the background mode capability is turned on, and if the app is backgrounded or even terminated while a Bluetooth operation is still ongoing, iOS may keep the Bluetooth state alive, and attempt to restore it on resuming the app, so that the connection and operation between the app and the Bluetooth accessory is not interrupted and severed.

        - Parameter on: the characterstic that is still being listened on when the CoreBluetooth stack is restored in the app.
        - Return: true if the characteristic's listen callback will be restored, false if the characteristic's listen should be cancelled and not restored.
